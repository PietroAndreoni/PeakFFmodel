- model shows a strong dependence in early years of BAU scenarios to the production upper bound from the geometric equation. 
This means that the model is infeasible without dummy support with the choosen maximum rate of production r(i): are they too low? (maybe confront them with current data to check r calculated values). 
To give an idea: model becomes feasibile only at r(i) around .1, when maximum rate from data to 73 to 2014 are almost half of that value for the three fossil fuels.
The other way around, in some bau scenarios, in 2050 dummy account for almost half of the total demand. That means a huge shortage of FF resources.

- About production and dummy: there's still a problem i tried to solve making EM an intensive variable (why doesen't it work?), ie production is more than zero when demand is zero, ie "free production". That's even stranger because when the sum(p(i)) = 1 costraint is released the overall value goes above one instead of decreasing [at tmax, maybe is due to boundary behaviour], and in some SSP it seems to work while SSP1 keep the constraint even if demand is equal to zero during the last tree decades.
The problem can be overcome with post calculation (simply not accounting for production if demand is zero), but the whole thing is very frustrating. SOLVED with suggesting level of production at 0 if demand is 0

- PROBLEM: the model does not account for tstep. Simply adding it in Np equation (ie Np(t+1) - N(t) = D(t)*P(t)*tstep) gives absurd results, however should be correct. 
Solution 1: discretize at tstep = 1 
Solution 2: ?

- maybe Pcostr condition should be related to gross demand instead of production mix. Think well about the conditions 

ALL PREVIOYS SOLVED

Paper, todo and structure

1) intro
- SSPs
- hubbert peak
- drivers and indicators for future fossil fuel demand: POP, GDP, CI, EI

2) metodology
- assumptions: no CCS, all CC is due to C02, all C02 is due to fossil fuels
- exogenous demand
- demand driven consumption of oil&gas
- two policy scenarios (maybe add 1.5°C?)
- dummy variable: use, model, type
- post solve operations

3) results
- major trend consistent through scenarios:
1) in RCP26, coal out and almost all of Oil&Gas proven resources used
2) in BAUs, major shortages after mid century (and sometimes after 2030)
- total emission consistent with target in RCP26?
- what happens if we use just coal to do RCP26?
- sensitivity analysis: r value, K(i) value - in particular for oil&gas
- Additional scenarios "major discoveries" or "major tech improvement" in oil&gas reservoir: confront cumem with standard RCP26 scenarios

OTHER FEATURES/SCENARIOS
- IEA scenario for proven reserves (now is BP)
- MAJOR DISCOVERY SCENARIO at a certain time t ne t0 
- RCP19 SCENARIO

cut/copy of old TODOs
PROBLEMS E TODO
- set initial values for the system  DONE
- set lower and upper boundaries to stability
- create tables and data for multidimensional parameters  DONE
- decide and add some parameters (K, r e maxfs)
- increase robustness: what happens if FF cannot meet the demand?
- sensitivity analysis: what happens if K(i) rises?
(- introducing price as a variable and endogenizing non fossil substitutes)
- Add a small climate model to translate cumulative emissions as concentrations
- Hubbert geometric model does apply to coal?
- make a confrontation between historical production and theoretical Hubbert maximum
production to see if different fossil fuels are or not demand driven
- introduce a "dummy variable" modelled as a fourth FF with very high emission intensity,
whose production start to zero. This way, if with a very low reserve scenario FF
cannot meet the demand, model is still feasibile, even if results must be manipulated
to remain meaningful.
- IMPORTANT: correct parameter FFIGDP which is now actually CIGDP (even if they are good proxy)
- in the paper: search dependence of oil consumptio vs population and vs GDP to show
that the second is stronger
- GAMS GENERAL KNOWLEDGE: is referring the equation to (t+1) the same as (ord(t) le card(t)-1)?
- Think about first condition in pggrateeq
